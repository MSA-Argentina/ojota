   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Ojota's documentation!
=================================

Ojota is a ORM and flat file database engine.

Ojota is Free Software! you can check the code at https://github.com/MSA-Argentina/ojota 


How does it works?
==================

First we will define the data object

.. code-block:: python

    # The information is stored in a file called Persons.json
    class Person(Ojota):
        required_fields = ("name", "address", "age")
        cache  = Memcache()

    # The information is stored in a file called Teams.yaml
    class Team(Ojota):
        pk_field = "id"
        data_source = YAMLSource()
        required_fields = ("id", "name", "color")

        def __repr__(self):
            return self.name

Just with that we can query the ORM objects

.. code-block:: python

    # Some Example queries
    # "all" returns all the Person Objects
    Person.all()
    # "many will return filtered results
    Person.many(age=30, sorted="name")
    Person.many(age__lt=30, sorted="-name")
    Person.many(sorted="name")

    # "one" will get only one object
    Team.one(1) # you can just send the primary key
    Team.one(name="River Plate")

    # You can sub-query over the results
    persons = Person.all()
    elders = persons.many(age__gt=30)
    fat_elders = elders.many(weight__gt=50)
    female_elders = elders.many(gender="F")

That's it your information will be stored in plain text and you will have a
powerfull ORM to play with it
